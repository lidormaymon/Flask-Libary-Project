In order to use this client on YOUR LocalHost, and open it you first must make<br>
yourself a virtual envioerment by typing "py -m virtualenvioerment env",<br>
and in order to activate it, type "env/scripts/activate".<br>

After that you're clear to run app.py, and open index.html, to use the browser.<br>
And make sure you change all of your MY_SERVER virable to your localhost server
