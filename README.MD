# Libary Flask SQL Alchemy client web
This is a client web database for a liabary and its stuffs, that allows them<br>
manage their books, customers, and loans data.<br>
You can add,remove,update and more features as of using toastr notifcations and etc..<br>

## Instructions:
In order to use this client on YOUR LocalHost, and open it you first must make<br>
yourself a virtual envioerment by typing "py -m virtualenvioerment env",<br>
and in order to activate it, type "env/scripts/activate".<br>
Then you need to install all the packages that I used by simply first<br>
navigate to the back folder by typing "cd/back", and then typing "pip install -r requirements.txt".<br>
After that you're clear to run app.py, and open index.html, to use the browser.<br>
And make sure you change all of your MY_SERVER virable to your localhost server

Besides that if you wish to just browser the server without installing it on your own computer<br>
here's the link to the web that's deployed, https://lidormaymon.github.io/Flask-Libary-Project/index.html .<br>
Enjoy!
